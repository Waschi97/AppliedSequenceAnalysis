Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 8 of /home/togepitsch/Development/Applied_Sequence_Analysis/Task1/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/togepitsch/Development/Applied_Sequence_Analysis/Task1/stats/ERR024606_tiny.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 7
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
